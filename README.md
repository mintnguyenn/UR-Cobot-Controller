# UR Manipulator Robots Controller

This software has been developed for controlling manipulator robots in the [UR series](https://www.universal-robots.com/), such as UR3(e), UR5(e) and UR10(e). The software facilitates communication with the robot via [ROS (Robot Operating System)](https://www.ros.org/) and can control either the physical UR robots or the simulation one in [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/home).

In addition, this repository includes MATLAB scripts that can also be utilized for controlling UR robots (without the necessity of using Linux OS or undergoing a build process like C++). These scripts have been crafted for teaching and learning purposes within the context of the 41013 Industrial Robotics course at the [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/).

## Prerequisite
1. A Linux machine setup with ROS. It is recommended to use Ubuntu 20.04 with [ROS noetic](https://wiki.ros.org/noetic); however, older versions of Ubuntu should function effectively as well.

2. ROS driver package for Universal Robots robotic arms: [Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver)
